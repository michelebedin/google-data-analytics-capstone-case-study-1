**How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?**

<br>

**Scenario**

> You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

<br>

**Characters and teams:**

-   **Cyclistic**: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can't use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

-   **Lily Moreno**: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.

-   **Cyclistic marketing analytics team**: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclistic's mission and business goals --- as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic achieve them.

-   **Cyclistic executive team**: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.

<br>

**Three questions will guide the future marketing program**:

-   How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

-   Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?

-   How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

> The course of study to obtain the [Google Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) was challenging, but in the end, all the knowledge acquired enabled me to get the professional title of Data Analyst Junior.
>
> The most exciting topic was the R language, which proved to be very useful in analysing data and finding answers to the questions posed in this *case study*. This process took longer than expected but was both exciting and fun.
